# TweakCN

[TweakCN](https://tweakcn.com/editor/theme) is a utility for creating and sharing themes for ShadCN's UI.

There is a list of `bunx` commands for a selection of default themes at `clinet-utility/styling/tweakcn.ts`.

Run any of these in `client` to install the theme automatically.

The default theme is **Graphite.**
