description: "Creates sidecar markdown documentation for source code files. Use when Claude needs to write or update documentation for code - creating new *.md files alongside source files, updating existing documentation, documenting individual files or entire projects, explaining code using Stage-Actor-Prop metaphor for both human and LLM readers"

# Documentation Writer

Creates sidecar markdown files (`*.md`) placed alongside non-autogenerated source code. Designed for both human and LLM readers.

## Documentation Template

Each documentation file must:

1. **Timestamp** the top with `Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` (UTC ISO 8601 format)
   - Generate timestamp using: `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`
2. **Use Stage-Actor-Prop metaphor** - Read references/stage-actor-prop.md in this skill's directory
   - **If file not found**: Apply the metaphor by describing **Stage** (environment/context), **Actor** (who acts), and **Props** (what flows or changes)
3. **Explain intention** - Why this code exists, what problem it solves
4. **Describe functionality** - What the code does, inputs/outputs, behavior
5. **Include examples** - Concrete usage patterns where helpful

## Documentation Structure

```markdown
# [Component/Module Name]

Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ

## Purpose

[Why this code exists, what problem it solves]

## Stage-Actor-Prop Overview

[Primary Stage-Actor-Prop sentence describing the main behavior]

## Components

[For larger files: break down functions/classes/modules, each with Stage-Actor-Prop descriptions]

## Usage

[Examples, parameters, return values]

## Dependencies

[What this code depends on, how it relates to other modules]

## Notes

[Important details, edge cases, design decisions]
```

## When to Create Documentation

Create or update documentation when:

- Adding new non-autogenerated source files
- Significantly modifying existing code
- User requests documentation for a file or project
- Code is complex or non-obvious
- Explaining code to users

## Skip These Files

Do NOT document:

- Generated files (wailsjs/, node_modules/, build/, dist/)
- Test files (unless requested)
- Configuration files (unless complex logic)
- Simple utility files (<20 lines, obvious purpose)
- Boilerplate or template code

## Process

1. **Identify files** - List all non-autogenerated source files requiring documentation
2. **Read source** - Understand the code's purpose and behavior
3. **Apply metaphor** - Read references/stage-actor-prop.md from this skill's directory, or describe Stage (environment), Actor (who acts), Props (what flows) if file is missing
4. **Generate timestamp** - Run `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` to get current UTC timestamp in ISO 8601 format
5. **Write markdown** - Create sidecar `*.md` file with timestamp
6. **Include examples** - Add concrete usage patterns where helpful

## Resources

- references/stage-actor-prop.md - Located in this skill's directory (`.agents/skills/documentation-writer/references/`)
  - Complete guide to the Stage-Actor-Prop metaphor with examples
  - If missing: Apply metaphor by describing Stage (environment), Actor (who acts), Props (what flows)
